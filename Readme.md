# Fix My Cycle - Team 25

Our online cycle repair platform is here to make life simpler for bicycle owners, especially those living in colder places like Finland.

The platform comes with a helping users find nearby repair centers. In extreme weather conditions, our users also have the option to have a service person come directly to their homes.
