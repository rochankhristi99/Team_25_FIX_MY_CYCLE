# Fix My Cycle - Team 25

Our online cycle repair platform is here to make life simpler for bicycle owners, especially those living in colder places like Finland. Instead of dealing with harsh weather to get to a repair shop, users can easily book repair services from the comfort of their homes. The platform comes with a helping users find nearby repair centers. In extreme weather conditions, our users also have the option to have a service person come directly to their homes.
